# Wet Rave!
A game for [Strawberry Jam 3](https://itch.io/jam/strawberry-jam-3/).  
You are a DJ. You've headed to a known lewd rave to play your set, but these things can be distracting - complete your set perfectly or the patrons might get mad!  
The full game will feature both a practice (scored) mode, and a "live" mode where a single error ends the game.

## Known Issues
The aim is for all of these to be fixed before the end of the jam, but that might not happen.  
* Currently all timing is done in seconds, not beats.
